# CashCollector


Cash Collection application with a restful backend and mobile and web as front ends.

The CashCollector has a list of tasks where he/she goes to a customer and collects cash from, indicating the customer's info. i.e. name, address, amount_due (currency), amount_due_at (datetime), etcâ€¦

The CashCollector can see only one task at a time (the next task only) (They may however have read-only access to the tasks that he/she has already done)

The CashCollector should deliver the collected cash to the Manager.

The CashCollector has the freedom to go to the Manager whenever he/she wants to.

The CashCollector should able to deliver any number or all of tasks when they are delivering.

However, as a business we are afraid that the CashCollector will abuse the system and never deliver the amount they collected, thus we need to mark him/her as frozen if he/she has an amount greater than 5000USD for a period longer than 2 Days.

If the cash collector has 5000USD or more for 2 days or more, we should flag their account as frozen
